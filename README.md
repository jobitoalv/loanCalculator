# loan_calculator
a simple loan calculator using Bootstrap and jQuery. The calculator allows the user to enter the loan amount, interest rate, and number of years to repay the loan. When the user submits the form, the JavaScript code will calculate the monthly payment, total payment, and total interest.

The HTML code uses the Bootstrap CSS framework to style the page and the form elements. It also includes the jQuery library, which is used to add event listeners and handle the form submission.
